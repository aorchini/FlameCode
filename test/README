Python:

List slice notation
a[start:end]    # items start through end-1
a[start:]       # items start through the rest of the array
a[:end]         # items from the beginning through end-1
a[:]            # a copy of the whole array
a[-1]           # last item in the array
a[-2:]          # last two items in the array
a[:-2]          # everything except the last two items
a[::2]          # every two items
a[start:end:n]  # print every n elements starting from start to end-1
a[::-1]         # reverse a string

STATUS

I can now correctly solve the eigenvalue problem for a flame with curvature and convective, incompressible flow model.

TODO:
1) Adapt for the case axi = 0.
2) Add routine that calculate TF
3) Add routine that enables to manage parameters
4) Add GUI
5) Add flow models (axi = 1-0, incompressible = 1-0 ...)
6) Unify derivatives functions. I have written and tested new derivative functions in derivsnew.
   Now change the code and use these functions! I need to properly set the boundary conditions.
   Check that the old results and the new are the same!
